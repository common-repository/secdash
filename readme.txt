SECDASH allows website owners to monitor the security of their WordPress installation and Plugins in almost real time.

== Description == 

SECDASH is a cloud-based website monitoring platform that empowers organizations with multiple websites to always know if they up-to-date and secure.

We provide organizations the SECDASH plug-in that they install on their website/s. The plug-in continuously sends us data of the websiteâ€™s software assets (Content-Management-System (CMS), the installed modules). The data includes information such as names, version numbers, etc. At the other end we crawl the web and aggregate information that affects these website components such as available updates and security vulnerabilities.

SECDASH then matches the information and figures out if all parts of the website are okay. If not, SECDASH notifies the right person that is responsible for the affected website and component. In addition, we provide a dashboard that shows and visualizes all the information about the websites and its modules.

Try it out here: [secdash.de](https://www.secdash.de/)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `secdash` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
